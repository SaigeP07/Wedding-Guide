        <strong><p id="weather-text" class="weather-text msg-stay"><strong>September is one of the driest months of the year in Washington, so the chance of rain during the visit is slight to moderate. The days will also be long, with the average amount of daylight being 13 hours and 22 minutes.  Rain in the area is typically a light drizzle, so a rain coat is recommended to pack. If you are planning on hiking in the area, it is recommended to pack multiple light layers so you can be comfortable for the entire trek. Also, bring comfortable shoes to explore the city! For the most part, sweaters, light jackets, and long pants should be enough to be comfortable this time of year!</strong>
        </p></strong>
