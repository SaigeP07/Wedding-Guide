        <p class="msg-stay">In addition to the wedding on Thursday, we are also inviting everyone to join us for dinner in Seattle in lieu of a traditional rehearsal dinner. We want nothing more than to enjoy the company of everyone we love in one place! We are also wanting festivities to continue the evening of our wedding, by way of a pub crawl in downtown Port Angeles. There are multiple bars, shops, and pubs that we’d like to check out that are all within a short walking distance of each-other. We hope It’ll be a great way for us to enjoy everyone’s company in a casual and fun setting.</p>
