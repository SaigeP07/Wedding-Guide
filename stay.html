        <p class="msg-stay">Each airline also has pros and cons to consider. American Airlines has a great loyalty program as well as lounge access. Delta Airlines have wider and more spacious seating options, more flexibility with tickets and no changing fees, and the first checked bags fees are waived at check in. Southwest is also very flexible, has many flight options, and each passenger gets one free checked bag, as well as an overhead carry on and an under seat personal item</p>
