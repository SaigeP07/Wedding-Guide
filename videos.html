        <h2>Helpful Videos</h2>
        <p>We wanted to include some videos we thought would be helpful for planning things you might want to do while you're here. Included are videos on things to do in both Seattle and the 2 nearest National Parks. We also encourage you to do research on what activities will be available for you within the town/city you choose to stay in.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A Note for those wanting to visit the National parks: There are several entrances to each national park and it will be important to plan your trip around which entrance is closest to you. (Trails and Parking overlooks are limited to whichever entrance is nearest to you: more information on helping to plan your park trip can be found at the bottom of this Video Section.)

        <h3>National Park Resources</h3>
        <p>Below are links to the offical Government landing page for each national park. There you will find useful information on planning your visit, incluiding basic info, directions & tranportation, places to go, things to do, safety, and more.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Olympic National Park: Plan your visit <a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/index.htm">link</a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Mt Rainier National Park: Plan your visit <a href="https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/basicinfo.htm">link 1</a> + <a href="https://www.nps.gov/mora/index.htm">link 2</a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Keep in mind that information for both national parks will be updated throughout the year, therefore you should wait to plan what you want to do in either park until it gets closer to your travel date. (Road openings and closures, what areas are accessible, safety, etc.)</p>
